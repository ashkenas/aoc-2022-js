# Advent of Code 2022
This repository contains my attempts to write terrible JavaScript to solve 2022's edition of AoC. All solutions can be executed in the developer console on the input page for that problem. Employers please ignore this repository I promise I would never write like this for production :) this is just a gag I swear
